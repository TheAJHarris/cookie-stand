# LAB - 7 

## Constructor

Today I replaced all the object literals from lab 6 with a constructor. Then I attempted to create a list instead of the unordered list I had previously.

### Reflections and Comments

This was definitely difficult. I grasped the constructor function well, but I am having trouble with the table.  I hope code review tomorrow clears some things up.
